### Wordify  - convert text files to docx
#### Write text files in vim and convert to docx without leaving the terminal.

These are a few scripts put quickly together to allow notes and basic word docs to be written in vim, or a similar text editor, and be converted quickly to docx files. Part practice, part fun, and maybe part useful.

* Very basic - currently only supports converting text files
* Markdown support coming

To install quickly, just run install.sh, or open the file and follow the commands manually.
